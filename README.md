## Supporting Notes
<div style="text-align: justify">
Living in the American midwest has positioned our identities as either ephemeral eventually assimilating into the larger. culture or as permanently othered. A view that denies the validity of experiences of those who have made this their home and those who know no other land. It’s the constant struggle articulated by W.E.B Dubois to exist in psychic duplicates double consciousness reconciling your self view with the self observed through the lens of society. Conversations about who <i>you</i> are, <i>what</i> you are and where you are "really from". Not everyone struggles with this in the same way and for some of us these discussions might be easier to navigate than it is for others. But what’s important at whatever stage you are at in your understanding is knowing that you are not alone. We want to build an outlet to voice the stories that are often lost or taken for granted in a region that is of ten treated the same.
<b>For the people who exist between</b> imaginary borders with family on both sides.
