Hello Everyone,

### Group Message - 9:19:19
I just wanted to give some information about my "role" within in region...um, I and chad talked some centuries ago, and basically, I'm like a digital custodian. So, my role is to support the design, development/implementation, of digital products (and whatever else Chad wants me to do) for region (i.e., website, digital-zine, etc.). I will be putting such digital products in this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/eoduniyi/REGION-DIGITAL
At any rate, these digital products will all take a ~BACKSEAT~ to the physical manifestation until we have solidified these systems.

Region-Website:
Going to continue proto...typing various UI/UX for the website so I can share it with you all. Would be cool to post these in the slack.

Region-Digital-Zine:
Me and Chadwina talked about creating a digital experience for the first issue, where the content will be virtually (pun....) the same, but differ in various interactive
components. You can imagine a digital pop-up book version.

Here are some examples:
ISUU

-- We're trying to something cooler than just putting it on ISUU

pdf: https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/HFsr19%20summer%20zine%20demo.pdf
-- This was a side project I designed during my internship

Summer-Project-2
https://storage.googleapis.com/root-proposal-1246/Harvard-Forest-REU2019/forestSR2019Demo-2.mp4
-- This was another prototype of the side project I designed during my internship using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Hopefully I can prepare a more comprehensive presentation by the 6th!
